# HotKeys service for Ms Windows
This programme uses low-level keyboard access. The received data is processed according to the configuration file and passed on. There are several interesting features of this service: 
- You can use simultaneous joint pressing of any keys on the keyboard. 
- You can use paired keys as hotkeys, e.g. left shift and right shift/left win and right win, etc.

The settings can be found in the Config.CFG configuration file in the programme folder. Instructions on how to develop the configuration are inside the file.
